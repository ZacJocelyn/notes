# Data Structures
* The most fundamental concept in CS

* A way to store and organize data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently

## Data is everywhere
* The way we store, organize and group
* EXAMPLE: Dictionary!!
* EXAMPLE 2: Google maps

## Different Structures are needed for different things
* Text
* Images
* Relations

## How we store
* if we do not store intellegently then our app with not be EFFICINT

## Why do we care
* computer memory and speed are finite resources

## Memory management
* In lower level langs like C and C++ you must manually allocate and deallocate memory as  you use it
* JavaScript uses Garbage Collection

## We talk about DS in two ways
* Mathematical and logical models
* Implementation

## Abstract view
* EXAMPLE TV
 - turned on/off
 - receive signals
 - AV

## Abstract Data Type
* We can make our own data types
 - C++ Java JavaScript

## List ADT
* Store a given number of elements
* Read elements at a position
* Modify elements at a position
