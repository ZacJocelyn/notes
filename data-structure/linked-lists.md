# Linked List

## Identify
* Linear collection of data elements called nodes, referencing the next node

## Different kinds
* Doubly
* Circular

## Pros and Cons
* Dynamic data structure (good)
* Node operations are easy to implement (good)
* support different data types (good)
* must be read sequentially (bad)
* more memory allocation (bad)

## Access time
* insert
* remove

## Problems
* need constant time for insertion and deletion
* the data length is Dynamic
* don't need to access random elements
* different types
