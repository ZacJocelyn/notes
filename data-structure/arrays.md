# Arrays

## Identify
* A collection of elements Identifies by an index or key
* an array is stored so the position of each element can be computed from its index with math
* The simplest type of data structure is a linear array, also called one-dimensional array

## Diagram
* long rectangle with slots for each value

## Members
* Indexing
  - Access a value given an index
  - update a value given an index

## Access time
* MATTH
  - Starting memory location plus index multiplied by the size (in bytes)

## Problems
* When to use Arrays
  - Need to access the elements using index
  - know the size of the array before defining the memory
  - Speed when iterating through all the elements in the sequence
  - Memory constrained
