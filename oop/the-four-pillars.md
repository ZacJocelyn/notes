# OOP with CJ

## Objectives
  * Define encapsulation, inheritance

## The 4 Pillars
  * encapsulation
  * inheritance
  * polymorphism
  * abstraction

### Encapsulation
  * A mechanism of binging together the data and the code, so that they are not misused or accidentally modified

  * EXAMPLE
    - You go to the pharmacy and provide your prescription to the pharmacist. Only the pharmacist has access to the medication in the store based on your prescription.

  * More maintainable
    - We know exactly which class a specific behavior or property belongs in. We don't have to touch multiple classes/files when an update is needed

### Inheritance
  * The process by which one object acquires the properties of another object

  * EXAMPLE
    - A "house" or "apartment" are a type of building
    They both have the property number of floors. Therefore an apartment and a house can inherit the property number of floors

  * More maintainable
    - Prevents duplicating code across classes. Define the common functionality between things

### Polymorphism
  * Polymorphism is the process of exhibiting multiple actions with only one interface

  * EXAMPLE
    - If you can answer the question is-A with multiple things, a class is said to be polymorphic.
    A deer is an animal but is also a vegetarian
    An animal can walk. A vegetarian only wats vegetables
    A deer can talk and only eats vegetables

  * More maintainable
    - Code is more concise if you don't have to check for multiple types

### Abstraction
  * Abstraction os the process of hiding unnecessary details from the user to avoid complexity and distraction

  * EXAMPLE
    - When you press a button on the TV remote and your TV does the thing. You don't need to know anything about how the remote or the TV was built all you know is, it works.

  * More maintainable
    - We don't have to worry about code we don't know about
